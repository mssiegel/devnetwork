# devnetwork
Social network for programmers to stay connected with friends and coworkers.
At DevNetwork, you start by creating a profile of your job experiences and skills. Afterwards, create your own posts or read other people's posts and comment on them. 

Dev Network was built using the MERN Stack of MongoDB, Express, React, Node, and Redux.
